Base template for Dean's content page. Need to learn how to use Markdown rather

Testing images via markdown

![Sasebo orphanage news story shoot](/assets/img/Dean/Shoot.JPG)
![Look at me all snazzy-like](/assets/img/Dean/Headshot.jpg)

Testing aligning images via HTML, since markdown doesn't seem to have the option

<center>
		<img src="/assets/img/Dean/Shoot.JPG" alt="Sasebo orphanage news story shoot" style="width:40%;">
		<img src="/assets/img/Dean/Headshot.jpg" alt="Look at me all snazzy-like" style="width:40%;">
</center>
