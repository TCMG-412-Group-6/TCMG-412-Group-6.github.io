I figured I'd utilize my content page as a way for my team and class to get to know me better.

## About Me  

**Howdy!** Here are some things about me:  
- I'm Andrew James Dean, but everyone except my mother knows me as Dean  
- I'm 30 years old  
- A US Navy veteran  
- I worked in Mass Communications in the military(broadcast journalism and media)  
- I'm a TCMG Senior here at A&M, graduating in the fall  
- I am a **dog person**. Cats are *okay*  

I've enjoyed learning some of the broad strokes of what TCMG majors will eventually do.  
I'm relatively comfortable with a few coding languages, but the start of my senior year  
has shown me how much there is left to learn before I really become marketable in the field!  
My eventual goal is to hopefully work as an IT admin/sysadmin and oversee projects while  
maintaining the infrastructure that a company uses.  

I enjoy cooking, reading Sci-fi and Fantasy, hammocking, "prestige" TV, Film,  
playing with my dogs back home, and occasionally gaming on my computer.  

My Favorite quote:

 \- Terry Pratchett, Jingo

Check out a couple of the things I created when I was stationed in Japan:
