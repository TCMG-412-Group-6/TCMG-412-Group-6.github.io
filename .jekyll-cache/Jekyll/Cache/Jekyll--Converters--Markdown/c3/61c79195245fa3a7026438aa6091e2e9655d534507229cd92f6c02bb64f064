<p>He is a long-haired Dachshund. He will be getting a lady soon! He loves to play fetch. Don’t throw the ball if you don’t want to play. My girlfriend and I go on bike rides where he runs next to us. He will run 5 miles and still have energy for fetch. We ride through campus maybe you will see us one time.</p>
