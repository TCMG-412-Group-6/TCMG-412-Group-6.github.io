<center><p>My name is Britany Cano. I am a Junior here at A&amp;M and am majoring in Technology Management. I am currently 21 and have lived in Texas all my life, a small town called Beeville to be exact.</p></center>

<hr />

<p><em>How did i end up at A&amp;M?</em><br />
I choose A&amp;M due to its semi-closeness in terms of my hometown and also because of all of the people! &lt;/br&gt;

<p> A cool thing about my town, is most people from my high school have chosen A&amp;M for their college adventure as well. One being my roommate who is also in the color factory photo!</p>
