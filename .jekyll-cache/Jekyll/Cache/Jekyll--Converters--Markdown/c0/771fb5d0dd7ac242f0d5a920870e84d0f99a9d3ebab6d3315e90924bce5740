<p>I figured Iâ€™d utilize my content page as a way for my team and class to get to know me better.<br />

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p><strong>Howdy!</strong> Here are some things about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m Andrew James Dean, but everyone except my mother knows me as Dean.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m 30 years old</li>
  <li>A US Navy veteran</li>
  <li>I worked in Mass Communications in the military(broadcast journalism and media)</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m a TCMG Senior here at A&amp;M, graduating in the fall</li>
  <li>I am a <strong>dog person</strong>. Cats are <em>okay</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve enjoyed learning some of the broad strokes of what TCMG majors will eventually do.<br />
Iâ€™m relatively comfortable with a few coding languages, but the start of my senior year<br />
has shown me how much there is left to learn before I really become marketable in the field!<br />
My eventual goal is to hopefully work as an IT admin/sysadmin and oversee projects while<br />
maintaining the infrastructure that a company uses.</p>

<p>I enjoy cooking, reading Sci-fi and Fantasy, hammocking, â€œprestigeâ€ TV, Film,<br />
playing with my dogs back home, and occasionally gaming on my computer.</p>

<p>My Favorite quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€œBuild a man a fire, and heâ€™ll be warm for a day. Set a man on fire, and heâ€™ll be warm for the rest of his life.â€
 - Terry Pratchett, Jingo</p>
