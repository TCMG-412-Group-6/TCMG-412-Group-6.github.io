<p>I joined the Army when I was 18 and retired in 2019. As a Combat Engineer I learned to build simple structures, erect bridges and demolitions. In addition to that I also was trained in the use of demolitions to clear minefields, breach obstacles and permanently remove anything we wanted gone.</p>
