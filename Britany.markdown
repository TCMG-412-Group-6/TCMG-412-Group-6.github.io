**Howdy all!**
<br>
<center><p>My name is Britany Cano. I am a Junior here at A&M and am majoring in Technology Management. I am currently 21 and have lived in Texas all my life, a small town called Beeville to be exact.</p></center>

***

<p><em>How did i end up at A&M?</em><br>
I choose A&M due to its semi-closeness in terms of my hometown and also because of all of the people! </br>

<p> A cool thing about my town, is most people from my high school have chosen A&M for their college adventure as well. One being my roommate who is also in the color factory photo!</p>
